    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by
      the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough.[2] Croissants are named for their historical crescent
      shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
      in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a
      puff pastry.
